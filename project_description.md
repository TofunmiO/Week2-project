### SEO Tech Developer Week 2 Project
*This project implements Duolingo API to create a program called DuoBuddy.*

### How does it work?
Duolingo users input their username and password, it is authenticated and then they are walked through a series of instructions to output their friends in the app who are learning the same language as them and have the same proficiency level as them i.e they are in the same xp range.

It implements: Rapid Prototyping with Jupyter Notebooks, Basic Data Visualisations, Version Control, APIs, SDKs and Libraries, Parsing JSON in Python, MySQL Database, Style Check, Unit Testing, and Test Coverage Tests

### Inspiration
Elon Musk:
> "When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor."

### Blocker
Duolingo has no official API documentation so we were limited in the amount of functionality we could have and use.

### Installation
